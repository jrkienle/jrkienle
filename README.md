## 👋 Hey Hey, I'm James!

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile! I'm currently stuck on GitLab for my day job, so things 
might look a little empty here right now, but I promise I'm still spending all day, every day 
cooking up the most absurd code known to mankind.

### 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm a pretty open book, here's a few fun facts to get to know me a little bit better

- I started learning how to code when I was 6 years old (shoutout HTML and VB.net)!
- I dropped out of college after a year to become a full-time software engineer
  - Despite this I'm starting art school this fall with a dream of starting an indie game studio!
- I'm Seattle-born and raised and currently living in Spokane with my wife and 4 pets
- I got diagnosed with ADHD at the ripe old age of 22 (which explains a LOT)
- I once owned and operated an IoT powered coffee roastery in Portland, OR
- I'm an absolute degenerate with over 3000 hours in DotA 2 (I still suck at it)
- I played soccer for 15 years and am trying to get back into shape enough to join a pickup league
  - You'll find me suffering at the gym every day to reach this goal
  
### 💰 My Current Job

Right now I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Vanna Health](https://www.vanna.health/) where I'm
helping lead the charge to reimagine care and community for people affected by serious mental 
illness. My experiences growing up in Seattle, as well as my struggles with my own mental health have
made me incredibly passionate about helping those who struggle with mental health issues, and I
couldn't think of a better mission to work on than Vanna's.

### 🌱 I’m Currently Learning

- Rust! I love the idea of low-level memory safety, and it's been an enjoyable language to learn
- React 19 and the React compiler
- 3D Modeling with Autodesk Maya and ZBrush
- The fundamentals of game programming and game engine design

### 🔭 I’m Currently Working On

- [Manatee](https://github.com/jrkienle/manatee), my very own Rust-based game engine
- My very own completely self-hosted homelab
